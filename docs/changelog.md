# changelog

### 0.0.8
- changelog start
- unit and data-on functionality works, as well as SPA functions.
- dive functionality has not been verified and likely does not work.

### 0.0.13
- Further fixes as I find things (this is 0.0.x)
- Added a function dedicated to finding url hash and scrolling to it in otty.js
- Had a great time gaslighting myself because I could not for the life of me extend a class. But it turned out to be an issue with my webpack configuration, not my basic coding skills. Side effect of that is everything is now "export default ..." except for index.js.
