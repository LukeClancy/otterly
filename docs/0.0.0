# Why OtterlyJS?
- was using stimulusjs butttt
- querySelector navigation.
- single unit is valuable than an arbitrary number of them.
- use whats there (javascript) better
- less is more (small amount of code that is readable, modifiable and understandable)
- Can use alone or alongside something like htmx for more power.
# Required Javascript Info
- querySelectors, lots of knowlege on querySelectors
- functions
- binds
- events
- globals (yes use one)
- data-* attributes and javascript state / page loading
- Promises
- Dont use put.
# What we do
- top level example
## Setup
## html interaction
- data-unit
- data-x
- set aliases and helpers
## AJAX
- quickXhr
- dive, how dive works
- diveOpts
## Other
- Accessing units from other units
- Muti-unit units
- single page apps
- polling
## Anti-Patterns
- lots of unit types on a unit
- going too abstract
## Forms
- dont reload, use a pop up notification instead.
- avoid form-in-form issues. Give an example of
	selecting users when creating a convo.
- form nesting doesn't work
